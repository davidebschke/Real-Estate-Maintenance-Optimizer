# Git Workflow

Binding Git workflow for the Real-Estate-Maintenance-Optimizer repository. Referenced from `CLAUDE.md`, Section 9.

- Remote `origin`: https://github.com/davidebschke/Real-Estate-Maintenance-Optimizer
- Main branch: `main`
- CODEOWNER: `@davidebschke` (see `.github/CODEOWNERS.md`)
- New features/fixes via feature branches and pull requests against `main`.
- Branch numbers (the `<issue-number>` prefix in `.claude/rules/coding-conventions.md`) are assigned sequentially by the user across the whole repository, independent of actual GitHub issue numbers. Before creating a new branch, check `git branch -a` (local and remote) for the highest existing prefix and use the next integer — merged branches are deleted, so also check merged PR numbers in the commit history, not just `git branch -a`. Last number used: **28** (`28-feat-remove-sunday-scheduling`).
